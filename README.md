<h1>Overview</h1>

This project aims to develop a robust object detection system using Flask as a web framework. The system can detect objects from images or real-time video streams, classify them, and return relevant bounding boxes around detected objects.

<h1>Features</h1>

Real-time Object Detection: Uses [algorithm/library] for detecting objects in live streams.
Image Upload Detection: Upload images to the web interface for object detection.
Pre-trained Models: Uses pre-trained models for accurate detection.
Fast and Scalable: Flask backend ensures scalability for real-time detection.
Customizable: Easy to switch between different detection algorithms and models.
